# Liftoff example — Track Changes Blog Site

This is an example repo for [Liftoff – The Airtable CMS](https://www.github.com/postlight/liftoff), a tool by [Postlight](https://www.postlight.com) that lets you build static sites from content stored in an Airtable base.

This site showcases pagination, a lot of custom CSS, and markdown support, as you can see in the body of some of the articles. You can see these custom files [here](/https://github.com/fdsimms/tc-demo-liftoff/custom).

To get a look at the Airtable base used to generate the site, head [here](https://airtable.com/shr7hbMw5xSYt6r4V/tblUqMBOHEpQeIZ6w/viwmobeZBHQeAIcQK?blocks=hide).
